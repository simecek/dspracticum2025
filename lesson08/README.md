**Assignment 08** (due **Nov 10, 8:30 AM**)

Experiment with the [UnSloth Colabs](https://github.com/unslothai/notebooks) and try to make something **useful or funny**.

**Examples:**

- [Fine-tune an LLM](https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/continued-pretraining) on your own text corpus (the same one you used for GPT-2 training). Is it better than your character-level GPT-2?
- Use the ChatGPT API to create a small **classification dataset** (e.g. 100 examples for training and 100 for testing, similar to last year’s homework). Then fine-tune **Gemma 3** on the training set and evaluate it on the test set.
- Take a model that is currently **not included in MiniCzechBenchmark** and measure its performance on that benchmark.
