# Data Science Practicum 2025

Welcome to the Data Science Practicum at the Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, fall semester 2025/2026. This course aims to equip you with essential Data Science skills and introduce you to various machine learning techniques through 12 lectures. Rather than focusing solely on theoretical concepts, our emphasis will be on hands-on coding and practical applications.

## Course Info

While the course is still in development, you can refer to its previous versions from [[2024]](https://github.com/simecek/dspracticum2024), [[2023]](https://github.com/simecek/dspracticum2023), [[2021]](https://github.com/simecek/dspracticum2021) and [[2020]](https://github.com/simecek/dspracticum2020) to get an idea of the content and structure.

In the upcoming sessions, we will cover topics like *Convolutional Neural Networks*, *Transformers*, *Language models*, *Tabular data* and *Time series*. For the exercises and homeworks, we will predominantly use Python but it is ok to start with zero knowledge of Python under the condition you can code in other langugage (e.g. R).
